## Project Background
Freeland bunker was a mariner, world traveler, and business man from Winter harbor in the late 1800s. Starting in 1872, he wrote daily journal entries that included information about his life such as people he interacted with, places he visited, letters he sent, goods he sold, the wind and temperature, etc. 

These journals were discovered in an old suitcase and given to the winter harbor historical society, and since then, many community members have been working to transcribe and analyze the journals to try and synthesize a picture of who Freeland was and what life was like at this time and place in history.

Our team worked with the Winter Harbor Historical Society to utilize text analysis with R to inform further reseach into topics of Freeland's community, social, and economic involvement.

Our final product aims to provide access to the information we discovered in the form of a GIS Story Map that utilizes images, maps, and narrative to synthesize our research, accesible to anyone interested in learning more about Freeland Bunker, Winter Harbor, or history in general.
