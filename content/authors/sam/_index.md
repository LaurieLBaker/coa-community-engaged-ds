Sam Boss is the Assistant Director of Community-Engaged Learning and Research at the Harward Center. He grew up in rural, central Maine, and currently lives in Auburn with his spouse Katie and two children, Clara and Elliot. Before coming to Bates, Sam completed a PhD in History at Brown University. 

He enjoys teaching a First-Year Seminar at Bates that examines contemporary issues such as immigration, poverty, housing, and environmental justice by exploring Lewiston and its fascinating past. He is active with several local boards, committees, and non-profit organizations, including the Auburn Conservation Commission, the Stanton Bird Club, Maine Community Integration, Valo, and the Maine Humanities Council Veteransâ€™ Book group. 

His favorite hobbies are gardening, fishing, and baking/cooking, and he goes to Range Pond State Park in Poland with his family every chance he gets.
