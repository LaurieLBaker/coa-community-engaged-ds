Hello everyone! My name is Shea and I am a TA for the Community-Engaged Data Science class. I am a second year student at COA interested in combining my passion for  climate justice and conservation with my interest in data science. I will offer help sessions at a scheduled time each week, but if you need assistance at other times, don't hesitate to reach out. I am always happy to accommodate your schedule in whatever way I can. 

Looking forward to meeting and troubleshooting code with you all!
