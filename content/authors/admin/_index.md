Real-world applications of data science can serve the public good and help students develop transferable skills. In this project-based course students will work collaboratively with community partners to collect, visualize, analyze, and communicate data for a term-long data science project. The projects identified by community partners may have long histories or be in their infancy and each will have different data needs and goals.

This course emphasizes putting knowledge into practice, including going beyond individual fields of study to solve real world problems and understand community partner needs. Students will build skills in project management, using agile methodologies and frequent meetings with community partners designed to foster co-development and iterative and incremental project delivery. Students will also develop and improve their communication of data analysis projects and build skills in reproducible analysis and collaboration using modern programming tools and techniques. In addition to developing their statistical and programming skills, students will build qualities valued by employers, such as teamwork, reproducible analysis, effective communication, independent thinking, and problem solving.

This course is intended to appeal to a wide range of students and create an opportunity for students to do collaborative and advanced project work. Through the course, students will be exposed to a range of scientific ways of knowing and doing, helping students to cultivate an interdisciplinary perspective on what data science can do. Evaluation will be based on contributions to the process and final product of their teamâ€™s term-long community project, participation in skills workshops, and progress on their personal development plan.
