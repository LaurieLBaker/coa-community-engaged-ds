A key goal of this course is to particpate in knowledge exchange, particularly in equipping community partners with the data science tools to tackle issues of local importance. I am waiting to confirm dates, but there will likely be an opportunity to deliver an R training workshop to partners centered around the data science tools and technology to analyze and visualize their data.

Volunteering during the workshop will be counted towards one half letter grade, e.g. moving an A to A+ or B- to B.
