## What is a Personal Development Plan?

As part of the course you will be putting together and designing your own personal development plan. Personal development plans (PDP) are commonly used in industry and are typically planned and agreed upon with your manager. Personal Developments Plans are about reflecting on your current skills and knowledge and thinking about the areas you want to grow in. For this course your PDP will consist of making at least three personal goals for areas where you would like to grow in the class and putting together a plan for reaching those goals. 


### Creating Smart Goals

These goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based). An example of a SMART goal might be:

**Example Goal:** Improve my skills in data visualization

**Plan (during course):** 
* Work through independent gganimate/RShiny tutorials/leaflet tutorials, 
* Create a new visualization about the data each week.

Other goals could be: 
- Learn to use git from the command line. 
- Learn and implement a machine learning model, 
- Explore data science career options, 
- Improve leadership skills (lead sprint planning, or sprint retrospective, meetings with partners), 
- Improve science communication writing skills, 
- Learn about different forms of community engagement, 
- Learn and implement text analysis.

As part of your pdp plan you will identify readings and tutorials designed to help you work toward your goals.
