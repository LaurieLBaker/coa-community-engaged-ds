Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

- **Lyceum Forum:** The best way to get any questions on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on the lyceum forum. And you are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well. When you post a question on lyceum, you can choose to do so anonymously to your classmates. Note that the course instructor and tutors can always see your name, and this is for a good reason! We want to be able to identify students who might be struggling so that we can extend help. Similarly, we want to know who you are if you're providing great answers to others' questions! 
- **Student hours:** We will see each other most days during the course and there will be tutorial slots for additional instruction in some of the techniques you will find useful in your projects. If you wish to meet one on one outside of these hours, please send me an email to arrange a meeting. 
- **Email:** Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Lyceum), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, missed assignments).
- The [Math and Statistics Workshop](https://www.bates.edu/math-stat-workshop/) at Bates is open Mon-Thurs from 11-4 and 11-3 on Friday.
- For more general support and advice, please make use of the following resources:
  - Your student support advisor (especially if you are struggling more generally)
  - [Counseling and Psychological Services](https://www.bates.edu/counseling-psychological-services/)
  - [Health Services](https://www.bates.edu/health-services/)
  - [Multifaith Chaplaincy](https://www.bates.edu/chaplaincy/)
  - [Office for Intercultural Education](https://www.bates.edu/oie/)
  - [Accessible Education and Student Support](https://www.bates.edu/accessible-education/)


Make good use of this support system, it is there for you! And if you're not sure where to go for help, just ask.
