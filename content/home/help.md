Most of you will need help at some point and I want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

- **Google Classroom Forum:** Outside of project work sessions, please post any questions on google classroom. The best way to get answers on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on the google classroom stream. And you are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well.

- **Help Sessions:** We will be doing the majority of our coding project work in class. However, if you would like additional support, there will be one on one help sessions that you can schedule with the TA in class either as a group or individually.

- **Email:** Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Google Classroom), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, missed assignments).
- For more general support and advice, please make use of the resources on Campus which you will find in the College course catalog. If you're not sure where to go for help, just ask.
