You can choose whatever programming language you feel most comfortable using, however some project partners may request a particular language based on the tool that they are most comfortable using and where they will continue the analysis. You will each have access to an PositCloud account where you can analyze your data.If you have any difficulties with accessing a computer, let me know.
