### Books:

All books for this course are freely available online as e-books and/or linked articles. There will be specific readings for each project.

For project management and reproducibility you might find the following useful:

- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)

For programming and statistics you might find the following useful:
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan
- [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin.

- [R for Data Science Resource Board](https://trello.com/b/srJg0sHp/python-resources-for-data-science)

### Technology:

- Bring a laptop to every class, we will be programming most days! You can choose whatever programming language you feel most comfortable using, however some project partners may request a particular language based on the tool that they are most comfortable using and where they will continue the analysis. You will each have access to an RStudioCloud account where you can analyze your data. Feel free to use a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice.  If you have any difficulties with accessing a computer, let me know and we can arrange a chromebook from the library.
