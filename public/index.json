A reform bill to reinstate parole was recently passed in the house and the senate in Maine (see the full article in The Maine Public. The state legislature announced in April the creation of a 13-member commission to study restoring parole, with a December 1 deadline to make its recommendations (WMTW)\nThis project comes at a critical decision point for Maine. This work will build on work conducted in Professor Amy Douglass' class (Psychology 218) in partnership with the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition (MPAC) which researched perceptions of parole for violent and non-violent crimes and looks at the effect of different justifications on individual\u0026rsquo;s perceptions.\nThere is an opportunity in this project to look at broad questions including:\n What are Mainer\u0026rsquo;s attitudes towards parole for violent and non-violent crimes? How is parole for prisoners portrayed through media and facebook coverage? What can we learn from other states and country\u0026rsquo;s justice systems about parole outcomes? Can we use statistics and data to combat misinformation surrounding prison reform including beliefs about how common recidivism is?  This project can be developed in several directions, some potential questions include:\n How has reinstating parole and the reform bill been represented in the Maine media (newspaper, facebook) coverage? Do similar themes emerge when looking at the media coverage and the public\u0026rsquo;s perception of parole? What are parole outcomes in states with parole that are similar to Maine in terms of rural and demographics? Is there evidence for desistance (the reduction in criminal behavior that occurs after a person reaches adulthood)? Is there any statistical basis for individual\u0026rsquo;s perceptions on recidivism (recommitting crimes)? If the reform bill is enacted in Maine, how many individuals and who will be eligible for parole?
