With the help of volunteers, member field stations have been working to gathering temperature and intertidal community data at different sites along the Gulf of Maine since 2016, to establish valuable baseline data on changes in the Gulf of Maine.\nManomet is a non-profit organization that uses science and collaboration to improve the health of flyways, coastal ecosystems, and working lands and seas. The Fisheries Division works to sustain New England’s fishing heritage in a changing Gulf of Maine by restoring fisheries and diversifying opportunities in fishing and aquaculture.\nThe aims of this community project are several-fold:\nDevelop a protocol and data pipeline for carrying out quality assurance of the data, including developing a data workflow for future NeCSA data collection efforts and analysis.\nIdentify ways to improve NeCSA\u0026rsquo;s data collection process including developing standards and methodologies for data recording.\nCreate and design meaningful ways to visualize, explore, and present trends in the data (water temperature data, biological community data – species occurrence, species counts, biodiversity indices, and more) collected by NeCSA and Manomet to build a greater understanding of the Gulf of Maine\u0026rsquo;s intertidal communities and how they\u0026rsquo;re changing.\nSpecific milestones for the short-term for each of these goals include:\nCreate a data pipeline that takes the data from collection through to analysis ready:\nDesigning data visualizations and scripts for quality assurance and quality control checking: Pre-process the water temperature data to remove inaccurate temperature readings resulting from low tides. Create automated checks to flag unusual data entries. Identify ways to improve the data collection process based on:\nIssues that arise in the data processing. Design of data collection sheets. Record items that are unclear during the data process. Create a codebook for the data that will aid in further data processing and volunteer collection effforts. Bring the pieces above together to create a sketch of all the steps of the process including quality checks that should occur at each stage. Summarize, analyze, and present key preliminary findings:\nDevelop an Rmarkdown template to report overall NeCSA and Manomet data trends and results for individuals sites. Explore biological questions including: What species are most common? How do they vary across sites and through time? Do we see evidence of increases in invasive species like green crabs over time? What changes do we see in intertidal crab survey data collected by Manomet. How do the abundance and biodiversity measures vary across different sites? over time? and are these differences explained by environmental variables like temperature? or other site-specific characteristics? Taking a deeper dive into Manomet\u0026rsquo;s crab data surveys: How does crab density change over time and within and between sites? Are the differences statistically meaningful? What species of crabs are found, native crabs or other invasives (Asian shore crab), changing sex ratios, shell status and timing of pre-molt/soft shells, size distributions etc. How do the above trends correlate with environmental data (salinity and temperature)? What available environmental data might be most suitable for the site (hobo loggers at Robinhood Cove, Kennebec Estuary Land Trust, Friends of Casco Bay station off sandy point for the New Meadows site). Develop an interactive shiny application that allows users to explore and query the Gulf of Maine data. Student efforts will be continued this summer by an Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Fellow, who will use the pipeline developed to collate, clean, and analyze all five years of data from the 10 member stations.\nWhat skills you can expect to learn: Importing, cleaning and preparing data Design tests for checking data quality Data Visualization Automated report writing with Rmarkdown Statistical analysis techniques for working with biological data Science communication Knowledge exchange including documenting and sharing coding knowledge with community partners on analyzing environmental data from start to finish.

Tickborne disease are spread to humans through the bite of an infected deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) and can have serious health implications (see table below).\nDiagnosis of Lyme disease is typically through primary care providers. While 70-80% of people nationally infected with Lyme disease show a skin rash referred to as the \u0026ldquo;Bull\u0026rsquo;s-eye\u0026rdquo; rash or erythema migrans (EM) Maine Tracking Network. Further educational training on how to recognize Lyme disease in patients could help primary care provider\u0026rsquo;s diagnose the 20-30% of Lyme disease cases where the patient does not present the Bull\u0026rsquo;s eye rash.\nStudying Lyme disease incidence is a challenging problem. High Lyme disease incidence may reflect areas with a higher risk of Lyme disease or where primary care providers are able to accurately diagnose Lyme disease in patients. Similarly, low Lyme disease incidence may reflect areas with a lower risk of Lyme disease or where people with Lyme may not be seeking treatment or where primary care providers are missing Lyme disease cases. Passive tick submission data (where ticks are mailed in or dropped off at testing facilities) can give some insight into the prevalence of Lyme disease in ticks across Maine, however, this data can be biased by who submits ticks for testing which might depend on the Lyme disease awareness and concern of individuals.\nStudents will work in partnership with researchers from the Maine Medical Center Research Institute\u0026rsquo;s Lyme and Vector-Borne Disease Lab to explore, visualize, and analyze the data which could include interactive dashboard to map primary care providers and identify areas with a high-risk of Lyme disease where medical education training programs might be offered to improve Lyme disease diagnosis. Some questions students might consider in this work is whether to look both at areas with very low (possible undiagnosed cases) and areas with high incidence of Lyme disease, how to take into account the population and/or catchment area a provider serves, and how to consider and represent inequity in access to healthcare, including distance to a primary care provider or lack of insurance which act as barriers to treatment.\nDisease Cause Symptoms Health Implications Anaplasmosis Caused by the Anaplasma phagocytophila bacteria Symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, and body aches. Anaplasmosis can be a serious illness and can be fatal if not treated correctly. Babesiosis Caused by the Babesia microti parasite Symptoms include extreme fatigue, aches, fever, chills, sweating, dark urine, and possibly anemia. Babesiosis can be life threatening. Lyme disease Caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria The first clinical sign of the disease is a skin rash referred to as the \u0026ldquo;Bull’s-eye\u0026rdquo; rash or erythema migrans (EM). This occurs in 70-80% of people nationally, usually within 3-30 days after a tick bite. Other signs include arthritis, Bell’s Palsy, and heart problems.

Depending on interest, this project may consitute one or two projects depending on student interest:\nProject 1:\nThis project will build on work conducted in Professor Amy Douglass\u0026rsquo; class (Psychology 218) in partnership with the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition (MPAC) which researched perceptions of parole for violent and non-violent crimes and looks at the effect of different justifications on individual\u0026rsquo;s perceptions.\nThere is an opportunity in this project to look at broad questions including:\nWhat are the publics attitudes towards parole for violent and non-violent crimes? Do common perceptions about recidivism (recommitting a crime) and desistance (the reduction in criminal behavior that occurs after a person reaches adulthood) emerge from the survey or through the literature search? How has reinstating parole and the reform bill been represented in three Maine newspapers (The Sun Journal, Bangor Daily News, and Portland Press Herald)? Do similar themes emerge when looking at the media coverage and perception of parole in the survey Psych 218 conducted? How might the way the issues is covered affect individual\u0026rsquo;s attitudes about parole? Project 2:\nProject 2 looks broadly at what can we learn about recividivism and desistance from other states and country\u0026rsquo;s justice systems parole outcomes, and what the outcomes of the parole reform bill might looks like in Maine in terms of people released.\nWho are prisoners in Maine? Can we use data visualizations and infographics to educate people about prisoners and prison\u0026rsquo;s in Maine? Who? Why? What? Where? What are parole outcomes in states with parole that are similar to Maine in terms of criminal justice system, rural/urban population and demographics? Do we see statistical evidence for desistance (the reduction in criminal behavior that occurs after a person reaches adulthood)? How common is recidivism (recommitting crimes)? If the reform bill is passed, what would this look like in Maine? How many individuals and who would be eligible for parole in numbers?

For the purposes of the study, the term “immigrants” is inclusive of individuals, families and communities that are/or identify as immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented people, and their children/family members from diverse countries, all of whom are living throughout Maine.\nThe goal of this community project is to analyze responses from a survey assessing tobacco use and exposure to second hand smoke amongst immigrant communities in Maine and present the results in a report summarizing the key findings. The survey asks participants to reflect on the usage of tobacco before and after coming to the US as part of a broader project by CTI and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) which looks to study questions including but not limited to:\n∙ How does acculturation affect patterns of tobacco use and exposure among immigrants in Maine?\n∙ How does gender and other factors impact tobacco use among members of certain immigrants (country of origin, religion, shared culture, etc.)?\n∙ What protective factors and risk factors promote the development of culturally appropriate interventions to prevent and control tobacco use?\n∙ And to what extent are culturally specific tobacco control programs necessary to curb or prevent initiation of tobacco use among racial/ethnic populations?\nIn the project, students will analyze survey data from more than 150 respondents consisting of 7 questions for non-tobacco users and 20 questions for tobacco users. The aim of the project is to visualize and statistically compare the survey results. Preliminary questions explored in the data could include:\nHow common is tobacco use among respondents? How does this vary by gender and geographic origin? How did tobacco use change before and after respondent\u0026rsquo;s arrival in the U.S.?
